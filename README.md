        <h3>The tools I used in my web app is plain code using sublime text 3, I never relied on copying codes online<br>
        I only use my knowledge and what I have learned, I don't wanna show a very good web app just to show off<br>
        It is better to show what you really learn than show off what's not yours.</h3>

                I have learned nothing in this web app, I'm not even Interested in it.

                On this subject I have learned small things, since this is just an Introduction, <br>
                What really bothers me is that why is everyone so good in designing? I'm not good in it<br>
                I just put what I know, I'm not aiming to become a web developer. I just learned focibly just to pass<br>
                and I don't know if I'm gonna pass either. God help me.
            </p>
            <p>
            What is something I need to improve in web development is the interest to make websites. Ever since I forgot all my learnings in the past<br>
            I am kinda disappointed in my self because of that. I haven't really give much attention that I have programming skills, until I realize it<br>
            Information Technology is my 3rd choice in college and I have never Expected to take this course, And the moment I touch the keyboard I know<br>
            that I have forgot everything, it's all in the past now. I'm just learning to pass the course.
